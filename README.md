# Reinforcement Learning AI for game "soccer on paper"

Final version of my previous repository of Playgorund for this AI.

I've gathered here the best of my attempts and experiments.

## Implementation

This project uses pytorch for training models and pygame for visuals of the game.

Techniques used to train AI: reinforcement learning, SARSA, regular networks, convolutional networks, supervised learning for pretraining
